# Tree Diameter Analysis App
## Apsara Srinivas AssignmentB3
## Introduction
Welcome to the Tree Diameter Analysis App! This App helps users explore and analyze data on tree diameters across various genera. Utilizing the comprehensive vancouver_trees dataset, this application offers insights into the distribution of tree diameter sizes within different size categories

## Application Link
Access the old application live here: [Tree Diameter Analysis App](https://apsarasrinivas.shinyapps.io/AssignmentB3/)
Access the new application live here: [Tree Diameter Analysis App-B4](https://apsarasrinivas.shinyapps.io/AssignmentB4/)

## Features
- Genus Selection: Choose from a list of tree genera to focus your analysis.
- Size Category Visualization: View the distribution of tree sizes (thin, medium, thick) within the selected genus.
- Interactive Controls: Customize the analysis using sliders to define size thresholds and color pickers for visual differentiation.
- Data Tables and Downloads: Examine detailed information about trees in each size category and download the data for further analysis.
- Dataset Source: This application uses the vancouver_trees dataset, a comprehensive collection of tree data from Vancouver. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed for educational and research purposes. We are committed to open and reproducible science, and thus, users can directly interact with the data within the app or access it from its original source.
- The data can be accessed from the following website: https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.neighbourhood_name  
 _**Please note that 3/6 features were noted for marking in assignment B3, and the code is the same since I had additional features in my original assignment 
which I have marked here for a total of 6 features.**_  
## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of the vancouver_trees dataset for making this valuable resource available to the public. Their dedication to open data access greatly enhances our ability to understand and appreciate urban nature.
